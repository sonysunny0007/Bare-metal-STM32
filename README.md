Bare-Metal Programming

This repository is dedicated to exploring bare-metal programming on embedded systems. It provides practical examples and guides to interact directly with hardware without relying on an operating system.

Getting Started

Introduction
Bare-metal programming is a low-level programming approach where software interacts directly with hardware without any intermediate operating system or framework. This repository contains step-by-step examples to help you get started with embedded development.

Current Example: Blinky for Nucleo-F429ZI
The repository currently includes a blinky example for the Nucleo-F429ZI board.
The code demonstrates how to toggle an LED using basic GPIO configuration.
Why Bare-Metal Programming?

Efficient Resource Use: Direct access to hardware allows for optimized performance.
Learning Experience: Gain deeper insights into microcontroller architectures and peripherals.
No OS Overhead: Write code without the complexity and limitations of an operating system.
Prerequisites

To run the examples, you need:

Toolchain: ARM GCC or other appropriate compiler for your platform.
IDE: You can use an IDE like VSCode, Eclipse, or simply a text editor.
Debugger/Flasher: ST-Link or similar hardware for programming the microcontroller.
How to Set Up the Environment

Install ARM GCC Toolchain: Follow the instructions on ARM GCC Toolchain to install the compiler.
Set Up Your IDE: You can choose your preferred development environment, such as:
VSCode with Cortex-Debug extension.
Eclipse for embedded development.
Connect the Board: Make sure you have the Nucleo-F429ZI board connected via ST-Link or other compatible flashing tools.
Compile and Flash: Build the project and flash it onto the microcontroller using your chosen toolchain and debugger.
How to Use the Examples

Clone the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/bare-metal-programming.git
cd bare-metal-programming
Build the Example: Compile the blinky example using your IDE or command line.
Flash to the Nucleo-F429ZI: Use your preferred flashing tool (e.g., ST-Link) to load the compiled binary onto the Nucleo-F429ZI board.
Run the Code: The LED on the Nucleo board should start blinking, indicating that the GPIO is being toggled correctly.
Upcoming Examples

Additional examples will be added soon, covering:
GPIO configuration for different boards.
Timer and interrupt handling.
Communication protocols like UART, SPI, and I2C.
Memory-mapped I/O operations.
